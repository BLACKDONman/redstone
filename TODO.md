- handle directories that need to be available across all deployments i.e. a folder containing user's file uploads
- remove old deployment directories, so that the disk space doesn't grow too quickly
- allow the user to copy the node_modules directory from the previous deployment to the new deployment, to save time
- rollback
- database migrations
- support for custom commands, before deploy, after deploy (i.e. grunt support, bower component install)
